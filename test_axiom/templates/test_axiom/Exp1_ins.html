        In this first of 3 experiments you will decide between two options. In both options your payoff depends on the
    result of a random draw from a drum filled with balls and some unknown amount $X.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will conduct 2 draws. First we will fill the drum as shown in the table for "Option A" below and randomly draw a
    single ball. Then we will fill the drum as shown in the table for "Option B" below, and randomly draw a single ball.
    The whole process will be done by the computer.

        Before the game starts, we will give you an encrypted message. This message contains a random number between 0.00 to
        20.00. All possible numbers have equal probability. <strong>The number is randomly selected by the computer before the experiment starts
        and will remain the same</strong>. Once experiment 1 is over, we will give you the algorithm, the key and the mode to decrypt your message on a third-party website:
        <a href="{{ link }}" target=_blank>https://codebeautify.org/encrypt-decrypt</a>. Then you can get your result.
