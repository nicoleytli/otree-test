        In this experiment you will decide whether you prefer to play a lottery, in which the payoff is dependent on the
        color of a ball randomly drawn from a drum, or to receive a guaranteed amount of money.

        Before it starts, you need to choose one encrypted message. Each message contains a random number from 0.00 to
        20.00. All possible numbers have equal probability. <strong>These numbers are randomly preselected by the computer
        and will remain the same all through the experiment. The encryption key, algorithm and mode are all reset in this experiment. Different messages across experiments do not indicate different numbers</strong>.
        Once experiment 2 is over, we will give you the algorithm, the key and the mode to decrypt your message on a third-party website:
        <a href="{{ link }}" target=_blank>https://codebeautify.org/encrypt-decrypt</a>. Then you can get your result.
