        <strong>A CNN journalist says:</strong><br>
     "The turnout for the inauguration of President Donald Trump appears to be smaller than that of his predecessor as
        measured by the photo of the two events."
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>White House press secretary Sean Spicer says:</strong><br>
    "Some journalists reported inaccurate crowd numbers and used misrepresentative photographs to minimise the enormous
        support. 420,000 people used the D.C. Metro public transit on Jan. 20, 2017, compared with 317,000 for President Obamaâ€™s
        2013 inaugural. This is the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe."
