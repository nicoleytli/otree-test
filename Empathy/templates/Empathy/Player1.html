    Task 3: Two-player Communication Game

{% block content %}

    <p>
        This is a short experiment in decision making. In this experiment, you will be matched with another worker.
        Neither of you will ever know the identity of the other. The money that you earn will be paid to you in several
        days after this experiment, privately.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two possible monetary payments are available to you and your counterpart in the experiment.
        The two payment options are:
    </p>

{% if player.condition == 'E1' or player.condition == 'C1' or player.condition == 'G1' %}
    <p>
        <strong>Option A</strong>: 5 cents to you and 6 cents to the other worker
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Option B</strong>: 6 cents to you and 5 cents to the other worker
    </p>
{% elif player.condition == 'E2' or player.condition == 'C2' or player.condition == 'G2'%}
    <p>
        <strong>Option A</strong>: 5 cents to you and 15 cents to the other worker
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Option B</strong>: 6 cents to you and 5 cents to the other worker
    </p>
{% else %}
    <p>
       <strong>Option A</strong>: 5 cents to you and 15 cents to the other worker
    </p>
    <p>
       <strong>Option B</strong>: 15 cents to you and 5 cents to the other worker
    </p>
{% endif %}

    <p>
        The choice rests with the other worker who will have to choose either Option A or Option B. The only information
        your counterpart will have is the message sent by you. That is, he or she will not know the
        monetary payments associated with each choice.
    </p>
    <p>
        We now ask you to choose one of the following two possible messages, which you will send to your counterpart:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Message 1</strong>: “Option A will earn you more money than Option B.”
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Message 2</strong>: “Option B will earn you more money than Option A.”
    </p>
    <p>
        We will show the other worker your message and ask him or her to choose either A or B. To repeat, your
        counterpart’s choice will determine the payments in the experiment. However, your counterpart will never know
        what sums were actually offered in the option not chosen (that is, he or she will never know whether your
        message was true or not). Moreover, he or she will never know the sums to be paid to you according to the
        different options.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will pay the two of you according to the choice made by your counterpart.
    </p>
